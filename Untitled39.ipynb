    "1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking a specific value. The area under the curve of the PDF represents the probability of the variable falling within a particular range.\n",
    "Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete distributions: e.g., Binomial, Poisson, Geometric.\n",
    "Continuous distributions: e.g., Normal, Exponential, Uniform, Beta.\n",

    "Q4. What are the properties of Binomial distribution? Give two examples of events where binomial distribution can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties:\n",
    "Fixed number of trials.\n",
    "Each trial has two outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "The probability of success is constant.\n",
    "Trials are independent.\n",
    "Examples:\n",

    "\n",
    "Binomial: Deals with a fixed number of trials, with two outcomes, and a fixed probability of success.\n",
    "Poisson: Deals with the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, with a known average rate, and events happen independently.\n",
